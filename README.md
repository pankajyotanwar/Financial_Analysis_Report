# Financial_Analysis_Report
A Interactive dashboard built in Power BI on a product based company's data. It contains a number of visuals generating powerful insights.

STEPS I Followed:

1. Transformed raw data - with the help of data query editor and tools in data tab(table tools, column tools) and made sure each able serves a single, distinctive purpose.

2. Data modelling - Carefully established one to many relationships between lookup tables and data tables to reduce redundancy and preserve data integrity.
3. DAX ( data analysis Expressions) Created useful formula based calculated columns for filtering data and measures for aggregation and various other functions (statistical, logical, text, date & time, iteration, etc).

4. Adding Visuals in Report Tab - The financial Analysis page contains simple yet powerful interactive visuals to generate insights ( such as cards, slicers, treemaps, donut charts, etc).
  . Used Cards to show important values related to sales: Total units sold, Gross Sales, Total Profit, Sales After discount.
  . Used Column Chart to show Total Sales by Country and Total Profit by Country.
  . Treemap to show sales by product.
  . Donut Chart to show total units sold by segment.
  . Slicer to see sales data in a particular year.
  
 5. Published the report for everyone to see.
